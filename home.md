# Welcome to the 40 Percent Keyboards Wiki!

## Purpose

The purpose of this wiki is to provide a place to centralize information related to 40 percent keyboards. It is maintained and organized by members of the 40 Percent Keyboards Discord Server.

You can join the discord using our vanity link [https://discord.gg/40percent](https://discord.gg/40percent) or using the [direct link to the wiki channel](https://discord.gg/YwBWB9GEMp).

## So what is a 40 Percent?

In the spirit of inclusiveness, there is no definition of a 40 Percent keyboard on this wiki. This is a very, **very**, hotly debated topic and this wiki is not the place to provide a clear distinction for what a 40 Percent keyboard is. On the other hand, the idea is to give you all of the information needed for you to make your own decision on what a 40 Percent is.

Usually a 40% keyboard is smaller than a 60% keyboard.
This is often achieved by partially or fully removing the number row to achieve smaller height.
Some keyboards also remove keys from the remaining rows or alternate their layout to achieve a smaller width.

The most important part of 40 Percent keyboards is - Â _**Small keyboard = good.**_

## Okay, so how do I get started?

This page is a great place to start! If you're new to the Mechanical Keyboard community as a whole (or are just interested in getting your first 40% board), check out the [introduction page](/Guides/Introduction)! If you're a veteran, consider joining the discord (and contribute to the wiki).

Regardless of what you choose to do, we hope that you enjoy learning more about tiny boards. And, always remember, 40% keyboards - 100% toxic.
