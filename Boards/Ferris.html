<h1>Ferris</h1>
<p>Ferris is a 34 keys split keyboard, named after the Rustlang mascott, that tries to be about as cute as its namesake. The Ferris is minimalistic: it aims to be a functional, ergonomic keyboard that is pleasing to use as a daily driver.</p>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>The PCB Is open sourced with all files available on <a href="https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris">github</a>.</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<p>The Ferris comes in several different types including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><h6>Ferris Base:</h6>This describes the first ever iteration of the Ferris keyboard: a plain pcb with support for choc switches, and the same layout as the Kyria (but limited to 34 keys).</li>
  <li><h6>Ferris High:</h6>The Ferris high is similar the base variant, but with support for MX switches and updated copper pad and silkscreen.</li>
  <li><h6>Ferris Low:</h6>The Ferris low is similar to the base variant, but with support for Choc mini switches and updated copper pad and silkscreen.</li>
  <li><h6>Ferris Compact:</h6>The Ferris compact is similar to the base variant, but with Choc spacing (17x18 mm) instead of MX spacing (18x19 mm). This means it isn't compatible with as many keycaps, but doesn't have gaps with keycaps that conform to the Kailh datasheet, like the MBK keycaps pictured.</li>
  <li><h6>Ferris Bling:</h6>The Ferris bling diverges slightly from the minimalism of other variants to offer a broader appeal. Some features are: choc switches with choc spacing, RGB backlighting, tenting puck support, case support, and all microcontroller pads are broken out for ease of repairability and modability.</li>
  <li><h6>Ferris Mini:</h6>The Ferris Mini is a barebone Ferris supporting choc mini switches in choc spacing. It also exposes all microcontroller pads for ease of repairability and modability.</li>
  <!--<li><h6>Ferris Sweep:</h6>Info about sweep.</li>-->
