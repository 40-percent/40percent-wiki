<h1>Welcome to the 40 Percent Keyboards Wiki!</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this wiki is to provide a place to centralize information related to 40 percent keyboards. It is maintained and organized by members of the 40 Percent Keyboards Discord Server.</p>
<p>You can join the discord using our vanity link <a href="https://discord.gg/40percent">https://discord.gg/40percent</a> or using the <a href="https://discord.gg/YwBWB9GEMp">direct link to the wiki channel</a>.</p>
<h2>So what is a 40 Percent?</h2>
<p>In the spirit of inclusiveness, there is no definition of a 40 Percent keyboard on this wiki. This is a very, <strong>very</strong>, hotly debated topic and this wiki is not the place to provide a clear distinction for what a 40 Percent keyboard is. On the other hand, the idea is to give you all of the information needed for you to make your own decision on what a 40 Percent is.</p>
<p>The most important part of 40 Percent keyboards is - &nbsp;<i><strong>Small keyboard = good.</strong></i></p>
<h2>Okay, so how do I get started?</h2>
<p>This page is a great place to start! If you're new to the Mechanical Keyboard community as a whole (or are just interested in getting your first 40% board), check out the <a href="/Introduction">introduction page</a>! If you're a veteran, consider joining the discord (and contribute to the wiki).</p>
<p>Regardless of what you choose to do, we hope that you enjoy learning more about tiny boards. And, always remember, 40% keyboards - 100% toxic.</p>
<h2>How do I contribute to this wiki?</h2>
<p>To contribute, you will want to submit a PR (Pull Request) on the Git repository. Create a branch, make your changes, and submit your changes as a pull request to be merged into the main branch.</p>
