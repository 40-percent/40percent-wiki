# 40s Day

40s Day is on the 40th day of the year (February 9th).
People in the 40% percent community celebrate 40s day by both spamming pictures of their keyboards in the #pictures channel of the [40% Discord Server](https://discord.gg/40percent) and [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/).
40% community members also generally take this day as an opportunity to explain how they actually use their 40% keyboards to people who assume they are just novelties (also see [How page](/en/how)).

40s Day is unfortunately still met with much pushback on r/MechanicalKeyboards despite having gone on for several years at this point. 

## Collection albums

Some times after 40s Day, an album of the keyboards posted on 40s Day will be arranged for that year's collection.
