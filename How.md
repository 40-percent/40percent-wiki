# How

Good question. 

While it may seem like 40% keyboards lack functionality (_how do you type numbers?_), they often appear more functional than a plenty of bigger keyboards. This happens because the small form factor gives you an opportunity to utilize some advanced QMK features, including but not limited to:
1. Layers - temporarily alter your keymap by pressing or holding the layer key
2. Tap dance - assign different actions on tap, hold, double tap and tap+hold
3. Home row mods - use your ASDF HJKL keys as Ctrl, Alt, Super and Shift
4. One shot mods - press a mod key once and the next key will be pressed with that mod
5. Combos - assign an action to a simultaneous press of 2 or more keys at the same time (e.g. QW => Esc) 
6. Autoshift - automatically use shift if letter or number key is held

And more

To have access to these features, a lot of 40% keyboards use [Vial](https://get.vial.today/)-compatible firmware. Vial is a graphical interface for a lot of QMK features that allows you to set up those mechanics to match your needs.

This might seem rather complicated, and there indeed is a learning curve. Finding a *perfect* keymap for your needs is an iterative process which may take a lot of time. You can find examples of 40% keymaps in \#keymaps channel of [40% Keyboards](https://discord.gg/40percent) Discord server or on the [KeymapDB](https://keymapdb.com/) website.
