# Why use a 40% keyboard?

On a full-size keyboard, pressing less frequent keys involves moving your hands or stretching your fingers to hit small distant targets and then reorienting to the home row. That reaching is slow and can lead to hand issues; it also takes up space that might be short in a bag, cafe, plane or classroom.

A 40% keyboard uses layer-shift keys to move less frequent keys into layers under the fingers. Pressing a combination of easy-to-reach keys can be faster and easier than reaching for a distant key. Full-size keyboards already use shift keys for capital letters and most symbols; we don't have a larger keyboard with separate keys for each. 40% keyboards apply this same idea to a smaller set of base keys, often just the core letter area plus a few others. Access can be by pressing the layer and base keys together, in sequence, or other options. The user can customize which characters, strings or functions are on the base layer and how they access those on other layers.

A simple 40% keymap has two extra layers and two layer-shift keys. Holding one provides navigation, editing, numbers and functions; holding the other provides symbols. Many variations are possible, including richer navigation on a dedicated nav/edit layer or a leader key that outputs text snippets from short prefixes.

Preferred board sizes vary, but an easy start is 12 to 13 keys wide. That covers the letter area and standard side keys for delete, shift, return, etc. A bottom row holds thumb keys for layers and modifiers and may have side utility keys for arrows or extras. A smaller board, such as ten wide, continues the tradeoff between decreased size and finger reaching vs. more complex layering. Preferences also vary on the physical key arrangement: between row stagger, ortho-linear, or ergo/column stager and between unibody or split.

Many small keyboard users are programmers. We are often typing or editing and care about efficiency and hand ergonomics. There are keyboard uses where a function or number row is very handy, such as for graphical tool use with heavy use of function and modifier combinations or for gaming. But for general typing, including programming, moving the keys to the fingers instead of the fingers to the keys has advantages.

## Example keymap

The larger 40% keymaps are often easier to understand and can provide familiar base layer arrows and modifiers for new users while offering layer-based ones that are easier to access while typing. A simple keymap with two layer keys gives access to the Hillside keyboard's two additional layers when held. Numbers and symbols retain familiar locations, function keys line the bottom row, and navigation and editing keys are on the home row of the nav/edit layer.
