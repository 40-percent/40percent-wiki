Although people have different reasons for using 40% keyboards, some common reasons are:

- Small boards are easy to carry and fit on small surfaces.
- Small is cool, cute or elegant, based on taste.
- Good layers move many keys 'close', making small more efficient than large.

Small things fitting in more places is obvious and includes backpacks and small desks.
Many also prefer mechanical keys over rubberized dome keys and
  using fewer of the (bulkier) mechanical keys helps with portability.

Tailoring for just the needs at hand is elegant. 
If you normally type mostly letters, why carry around keys for the numbers and symbols?
Expressing individuality is also a need, and smaller boards are easier to customize than larger ones.
Some people like smaller boards with cool keycaps, cases and sound.

Effective layering can make small boards more efficient 
  than large unlayered ones.
Layers let keys do multiple jobs based on the other keys that are also pressed,
  just like the normal shift key does.
Using 'shifted' layers for more than just capitals means more typing can be done efficiently 
  with just the keys next to the fingers, including writing programs or novels.
Using a large unlayered board means reaching further for keys
  that layers can put right under the fingers.


# Why use a layered 40% keyboard?

On a common laptop-sized keyboard, 
  just under half of the keys 
  require stretching or moving the hands 
  followed by reorienting back to the home row, 
  including distant yet common keys such as the arrow and delete keys.
That reaching and reorienting is slow and can lead to hand issues.

Forty-percent keyboards reduce finger and hand stretch by moving some keys 
  onto added layers right under the fingers. 
Full-size keyboards already do this by using the shift key
  for capital letters and most of the symbols. 
We don't use huge keyboards with separate capital letter keys and far more symbol keys. 
Forty-percent keyboards apply the same idea to a smaller set of base keys,
  often just the letter area plus side columns, and they often have just four rows.

A simple 40% keymap has two new layers, reached from two new layer-shift keys.
Holding one layer key provides navigation, editing, numbers and functions; 
  holding the other provides symbols.

Pressing a combination of easy-to-reach keys can be faster and easier 
  than reaching for a distant key. 
Access can be by pressing the layer-shift and base keys together, 
  in sequence, or with other options. 
The user can customize which characters, strings or functions are 
  on the base layer and how they access those on other layers. 
Common choices include a number pad, 
  richer navigation and editing on a dedicated layer, 
  or a leader key that outputs text snippets from short prefixes.

Once effective layering is used, 
  similar full-size keyboards are unneeded bulk and expense.

Preferred board sizes vary, but four rows and 12 to 13 keys wide (12u-13u) is common. 
This is an easier size to start with, and many people find no reason to go smaller later. 
This size keeps the letters and outer columns (delete, shift and return) as the base layer,
  with a bottom row of central thumb keys for space, layers and modifiers, 
  and possible side utility keys for arrows or extras. 
It means the fingers never need to move far and allows a simple layering scheme. 
Smaller ten-key wide boards further reduce finger reach and size,
  but require more complex layering methods.  

Preferences also vary on the physical key arrangement
  between row stagger, ortho-linear, or ergo/column stagger
  and between unibody or split case bodies.
Some are more familiar, 
  while others are more common in high-end ergonomic boards.

Many small keyboard users are programmers,
  a group that is often typing or editing
  and cares about efficiency and hand ergonomics.
There are times when a function or number row is very handy,
  such as for games or
  graphical tools that have heavy function and modifier use. 
But for general typing, including programming,
  its often better to 
  move the distant keys to the fingers 
  instead of 
  the fingers to the distant keys.

In the end,
  small keyboards are a collection of choices and trade-offs
  about people's situation, typing and hands.

## Example keymap

As an example, the Hillside's default keymap has the core parts of familiar side columns, 
  base layer arrow keys, 
  and two central thumb keys that give easy access to two additional layers.
On those layers, numbers and symbols have familiar locations,
  function keys line the bottom row, and navigation 
  and editing keys fill the home row of the nav/edit layer.
The keymap was designed with familiar elements for easier initial use 
  but also with more efficient layer-based alternatives that can be grown into. 
The [KeymapDB](https://keymapdb.com/) has additional examples for different board size, shape, preferences and needs.
