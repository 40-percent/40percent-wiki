People have different reasons for using 40% keyboards, yet common ones are:

- Small boards are easy to carry and fit on small surfaces.
- Small is cool, cute or elegant, based on taste.
- Layers move many keys 'close', making larger boards less useful.

Small things fitting in more places is obvious and includes backpacks and small desks.
Many also prefer mechanical keys over rubberized chiclet keys;
  using fewer of the (bulkier) mechanical keys helps keep a board portable.

Tailoring for just the needs at hand is elegant. 
If you normally type just letters, carrying around the numbers and symbols is just silly. 
Showing individuality is also a need, and smaller boards are easier to customize than larger ones.
Some people just like smaller keyboards with cool keycaps, cases and sound.

Layers let keys do multiple jobs based on what other keys are also pressed, 
  just like the normal shift and other modifier keys do.
Using 'shifted' layers for more than just capital letters means more tasks can be done efficiently 
  with just the keys next to the fingers, including writing programs or novels.
Using a large unlayered board means reaching further for things 
  that layers can put right under our hand.
Layers aren't why small boards fit more easily in a bag,
  but effective layering often means small boards are more efficient 
  than unlayered large ones, once learned.


# Why use a 40% keyboard?

Just under half of the keys on a laptop require moving the hand or stretching the fingers to hit small distant targets and then reorienting to the home row. That reaching is slow and can lead to hand issues.

Forty-percent keyboards reduce finger and hand stretching by moving less frequent keys to be under the fingers on added layers. Full-size keyboards already do this by using the shift key for capital letters and most of the symbols. We don't have huge keyboards with separate capital letter keys and far more symbol keys. Forty-percent keyboards apply the same idea to a smaller set of base keys, often just the core letter area plus side columns, and often use just four rows.

A simple 40% keymap has two new layers and two new layer-shift keys. Holding one layer key provides navigation, editing, numbers and fumctions; holding the other provides symbols.

Pressing a combination of easy-to-reach keys can be faster and easier than reaching for a distant key. Access can be by pressing the layer-shift and base keys together, in sequence, or with other options. The user can customize which characters, strings or functions are on the base layer and how they access those on other layers. Common choices include a number pad, richer navigation and editing on a dedicated layer, or a leader key that outputs text snippets from short prefixes.

Once effective layering is used, similar full-size keyboards are unneeded bulk and expense.

Preferred board sizes vary, but four rows by 12 to 13 keys wide (12u-13u) is common. That keeps the letters and outer columns (delete, shift and return) as the base layer, with a bottom row of central thumb keys for space, layers and modifiers, and possible side utility keys for arrows or extras. It means the fingers never need to move far and allows a simple layering scheme.  Smaller ten-key wide boards offer even less finger reach and size, but require more complex layering methods. Preferences also vary on the physical key arrangement: between row stagger, ortho-linear, or ergo/column stagger and between unibody or split case bodies.

Many small keyboard users are programmers. We are often typing or editing and care about efficiency and hand ergonomics. There are times when a function or number row is very handy, such as for games or graphical tools that have heavy function and modifier use. But for general typing, including programming, moving the keys to the fingers instead of the fingers to the keys has advantages.

## Example keymap

The easier 40% boards to start with are those 12 or 13 keys wide; many people find no reason to go smaller later on. This size provides familiar side columns and can provide base layer arrows and modifiers. Yet it still allows more efficient layer-based alternatives that can be grown into. As an example, the Hillside's default keymap has two central thumb keys that give easy access to two additional layers. On those layers, numbers and symbols have familiar locations, function keys line the bottom row, and navigation and editing keys line the nav/edit layer's home row. This keymap was designed for easier initial use.

## Keyboard tradeoffs

Small keyboards are a collection of choices and tradeoffs:

- Smaller is more compact with less finger and hand travel, but extremely small has more complex or longer layer activation methods. 
- When creating a unique personalized board, fewer keys means being smaller and needing fewer parts.
- Physical key arrangement could be row stagger, othro-linear or ergo/column stagger, and the case could be unibody or split.
- Various case, switch and keycap materials, colors and designs.
- Layers can be activated with different methods: keys nearby, keys farther away, key holds, one shot keys, chords, and timing or repeat based.
- What goes on each layer.
- Layout within each layer: what goes on the thumbs, the home, top and bottom rows, and the sides.
