# Why use a 40% keyboard?

More than half of the keys on a full-size keyboard require moving the hand or stretching the fingers to hit small distant targets and then reorienting to the home row. That reaching is slow and can lead to hand issues. A full-size keyboard also uses more desk space and is harder to throw in a bag with a tablet to use in a cafe, classroom or plane.

Forty-percent keyboards reduce finger and hand stretching by moving less frequent keys to be under the fingers on added layers. Full-size keyboards already do this by using the shift key for capital letters and most of the symbols. We don't have huge keyboards with separate capital letter keys and far more symbol keys. Forty-percent keyboards apply the same idea to a smaller set of base keys, often just the core letter area plus side columns, and often use just four rows.

A simple 40% keymap has two new layers and two new layer-shift keys. Holding one layer key provides navigation, editing, numbers and fumctions, holding the other provides symbols.

Pressing a combination of easy-to-reach keys can be faster and easier than reaching for a distant key. Access can be by pressing the layer-shift and base keys together, in sequence, or with other options. The user can customize which characters, strings or functions are on the base layer and how they access those on other layers. Common choices include a number pad, richer navigation and editing on a dedicated layer, or a leader key that outputs text snippets from short prefixes.

Some people also just like smaller keyboards with cool keycaps, cases and sound, even sometimes ignoring ergonomics. Once effective layering is used, similar full-size keyboards are unneeded bulk and expense.

Preferred board sizes vary, but an easy start is 12 to 13 keys wide and four rows. That keeps the letters and outer columns (delete, shift and return) as the base layer, with a bottom row of central thumb keys for space, layers and modifiers, and possible side utility keys for arrows or extras. It means the fingers never need to move far and allows a simple layering scheme.  A smaller board, such as ten keys wide, continues the tradeoff between decreased size and finger reach, but needs more complex layering. Preferences also vary on the physical key arrangement: between row stagger, ortho-linear, or ergo/column stagger and between unibody or split.

Many small keyboard users are programmers. We are often typing or editing and care about efficiency and hand ergonomics. There are times when a function or number row is very handy, such as for games or graphical tools that have heavy function and modifier use. But for general typing, including programming, moving the keys to the fingers instead of the fingers to the keys has advantages.

## Example keymap

An easier board to start with is often one of the larger 40% boads. They provide familiar side columns and can provide the familiarity of base layer arrows and modifiers. Yet they still allow layer-based alternatives that can be grown into and are easier to access while typing. For example, two central thumb keys give easy access to the two additional layers of the Hillside keymap. Numbers and symbols have familiar locations, function keys line the bottom row, and navigation and editing keys line the nav/edit layer's home row. This keymap was designed for easy initial use.

## Keyboard tradeoffs

Small keyboards are a collection of choices and tradeoffs:

- Smaller is more compact with less finger and hand travel, but extremely small has more complex or longer layer activation methods. When creating a unique personalized board, fewer keys means being smaller and needing fewer parts.
- Physical key arrangement could be row stagger, othro-linear or ergo/column stagger, and the case could be unibody or split.
- Various case, switch and keycap materials, colors and designs.
- Layers can be activated with different methods: keys nearby, keys farther away, key holds, one shot keys, chords, and timing or repeat based.
- What goes on each layer.
- Layout within each layer: what goes on the thumbs, the home, top and bottom rows, and the sides.
