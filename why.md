# Why

On a full-size keyboard, reaching for less frequent keys involves moving your hands or stretching your fingers to hit small distant targets and then reorienting back home to press the more frequent keys. That reaching is slow and can lead to hand issues; it also takes up space that might be short in a cafe, plane, classroom or bag.

A 40% keyboard uses layer shift keys to move the less frequent keys into a layer under your fingers, just like many laptops use Fn and the number row to create a virtual function layer. A simple setup has two layer keys beside a smaller space bar. One gives a layer with arrows, editing, numbers and fn keys; the other with symbols. Many variations are possible, including more navigation options on a dedicated nav/edit layer (very handy) or leader keys that output text snippets from short prefixes.

People differ in how few keys they want. A width of 12 to 13 keys provides the letters plus "normal" locations for delete, return, shift, tab and esc. A bottom row of thumb keys for layers and mods plusk some side utility keys for arrows or extras is an easy start. Having fewer keys becomes a tradeoff between more complex layering vs. less reaching with the pinkies or thumbs. Personal preferences vary between row stagger, ortho-linear, and ergo/column stager and between unibody or split.

There are use cases where a function row is very handy, such as heavy graphical tool use with many function and modifier key combinations. But for general typing, including programming, moving the keys to the fingers instead of the fingers to the keys can be an advantage. Many people in the small keyboard groups are developers, we spend much of our time typing and hand ergonomics is an issue.
