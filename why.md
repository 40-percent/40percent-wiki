# Why use a 40% keyboard?

On a full-size keyboard, pressing less frequent keys involves moving your hands or stretching your fingers to hit small distant targets and then reorienting to the home row. That reaching is slow and can lead to hand issues; it also takes up space that might be short in a bag, cafe, plane or classroom.

A 40% keyboard uses layer-shift keys to move less frequent keys into layers under the fingers. Pressing a combination of easy-to-reach keys can be faster and easier than reaching for a distant key. Full-size keyboards use shift keys for capital letters and most symbols; we don't have a larger keyboard with separate keys for each. 40% keyboards apply this same idea to a smaller set of base keys, often just the core letter area plus a few others. Access can be by pressing the layer and base keys together, in sequence, or other options. The user can customize which characters, strings or functions are on the base layer and how they access those on other layers.

A simple 40% keymap has two layer-shift keys, typically pressed with a thumb. Holding one provides navigation, editing, number and function keys; holding the other provides symbols. Many variations are possible, including richer navigation options on a dedicated nav/edit layer (very handy) or a leader key that outputs text snippets from short prefixes. 

People differ in how few keys they prefer. An easy start is a width of 12 to 13 keys. That provides the letter area plus familiar side keys for delete, shift, return, tab and esc. A bottom row holds thumb keys for layers and modifiers, plus side utility keys for arrows or extras on some boards. Using fewer keys, such as a width of 10, continues the tradeoff between layer complexity vs. smaller size and less pinkie or thumb reaching. Personal preferences vary on how the physical keys are arranged: between row stagger, ortho-linear, or ergo/column stager and between unibody or split.

Many in the small keyboard groups are programmers. We are often typing or editing and care about efficiency and hand ergonomics. There are keyboard uses where a function or number row is very handy, such as for graphical tool use with heavy function and modifier combinations or gaming. But for general typing, including programming, moving the keys to the fingers instead of the fingers to the keys has advantages.

## Example keymap

On the Hillside keyboard, holding either of two layer keys gives access to the two additional layers. Physical arrow keys offer a familiar navigation option, with more complete navigation and editing on the home row of the nav/edit layer.
