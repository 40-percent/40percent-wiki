# Why use a 40% keyboard?

More than half of the keys on a full-size keyboard require moving the hand or stretching the fingers to hit small distant targets and reorienting to the home row. That reaching is slow and can lead to hand issues. A full-size keyboard also uses more desk space and is harder to throw in a bag with a tablet to use in a cafe, classroom or plane.

Forty-percent keyboards reduce finger and hand stretching by moving the less frequent keys to be under the fingers on some new shift layers. Full-size keyboards already move the capital letters to be under the fingers on the standard shift layer and move some symbols to the number row; we don't have huge keyboards with separate capital letter keys and more symbol keys. Forty-percent keyboards apply the same idea to a smaller set of base keys, often just the core letter area plus a few others.

Pressing a combination of easy-to-reach keys can be faster and easier than reaching for a distant key. Access can be by pressing the layer-shift and base keys together, in sequence, or with other options. The user can customize which characters, strings or functions are on the base layer and how they access those on other layers.

Some people also just like smaller keyboards with cool keycaps, cases and sound, even sometimes ignoring ergonomics. Once some effective layering is used, similar full-size keyboards are unneeded bulk and expense.

A simple 40% keymap has two new layers and two new layer-shift keys. Holding one provides navigation, editing, numbers and functions; holding the other provides symbols. Many variations are possible, including a number pad or richer navigation and editing on a dedicated layer or a leader key that outputs text snippets from short prefixes.

Preferred board sizes vary, but an easy start is 12 to 13 keys wide. That covers the letter area and standard side keys for delete, shift, return, etc. A bottom row holds thumb keys for layers and modifiers and may have side utility keys for arrows or extras. A smaller board, such as ten keys wide, continues the tradeoff between decreased size and finger reaching vs. more complex layering. Preferences also vary on the physical key arrangement: between row stagger, ortho-linear, or ergo/column stager and between unibody or split.

Many small keyboard users are programmers. We are often typing or editing and care about efficiency and hand ergonomics. There are keyboard uses where a function or number row is very handy, such as for graphical tool use with heavy use of function and modifier combinations or for gaming. But for general typing, including programming, moving the keys to the fingers instead of the fingers to the keys has advantages.

## Example keymap

Starting with one of the larger 40% keyboards is often easier. They provide familiar side columns and can provide familiar base layer arrows and modifiers. But they still offer layer-based options that are easier to access while typing. A simple keymap with two layer keys gives access to the Hillside keyboard's two additional layers when held. Numbers and symbols retain familiar locations, function keys line the bottom row, and navigation and editing keys are the home row of the nav/edit layer.

This layout was designed for easy initial use with a familiar arrangement of numbers, symbols and function keys. Further examples for different sizes, shapes, preferences and needs are at [KeymapDB](https://keymapdb.com/).
