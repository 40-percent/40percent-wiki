# Board Name
Brief 1-paragraph board description. Include items like, other names of the board, who created it, high-level description of the form factor, other significant details that make the board unique.

Please remember to add citations with footnote[^1] tags as this helps to keep the info in the wiki objective and make the sources of information clear. Prefer internal links to other wiki pages if possible, except in the [Availability](#Availability) section or if providing links to specific, relevant, reputable resources (such as the maintainer's open source repo on GitHub).

Most of the sections are optional, just as suggestions for content that might be useful. Feel free to add more sections if you think they would be appropriate.

## Overview (or History depending on context)
An image of the available layouts is useful. An external link to the KLE is acceptable here. Explain more about the project. If there are open-source resources, link them here as well.

Who came up with the idea, and when was it? What were the influences or inspirations? Who made the project? What format was it? When was the GB or IC run, what format, which vendors? Were there multiple versions or iterations of the project? You can include those as third-level sections like this:

### Round 1
Round 1 was a private GB, only cool kids. The maker delivered on time and everyone was stoked.

### Round 2
Round 2 was a Vickrey auction and a blatant cash grab. The maker took over 3 years to deliver, everything was scuffed[^2].

## Availability
If the IC or GB is running, include that info here. You can include external links to the vendor pages here. Try to avoid including external links in the rest of the content, using citations or links to other wiki pages if they exist instead.

## Citations:
[^1]: You can use [Wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/save) to make sure sources for citations don't disappear.

[^2]: If you include stuff like this be absolutely sure to back it up with a citation.
