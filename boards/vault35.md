# Vault35

The hallmark of a Vault35 is its 4u x 11u layout, small bezels, large blockers, and (usually) translucent case.

## Variants

Official Vault35 exists in HHKB and WKL variants.

The most popular variant of the Vault35 is the [HHKB](https://hhkeyboard.us/blog/the-mystery-behind-the-ctrl-key-and-unique-hhkb-layout) layout.The first Vault35 prototype close to how it exists today, was assembled sometime around September of 2021. In July of 2023, Cain posted a picture of his first functional prototype of a WKL Vault35, oddly enough in an aluminum case rather than the signature translucent cases that Vault35s were nearly synonymous with.

### Availability

Vault35 kits are listed on Cain's site, https://mechvault.net/, when available. Vault35 kits or PCBs may also be found in the 40% keyboard server's buy-sell-trade forum or on mechmarket. 

### Layout

As the Vault35 has several variants created by users other than Cain, only those created by Cain are shown here. 

### HHKB

## Community works

Several community projects have been created that are compatible with official Vault35 PCBs or cases.

### PCBs

One of the first non-Cain designed/produced Vault35 case-compatible PCBS was the [Ortho Vault35](https://github.com/galvy0/vault35_ortho) by galvy0.

A 40% user named Calvin produced a Topre variant of the HHKB Vault35 PCB and designated it the [Travaulta](https://github.com/calvin-mcd/travaulta-files).

Another 40% user by the name of jlw_ took it upon himself to design and produce a series of Vault35 PCBs by the name of "Pip Bois". Layout options included HHKB Universal, HHKB Katana, WKL Katana, WKL Ortho soldered, WKL Ortho hotswap, and WKL Universal.

jlw_ also created [vault35-katana](https://github.com/josh-l-wang/vault35-katana), an open source Katana stagger-layout drop-in PCB for HHKB Vault35 cases.
A production run was made during the end of 2023.

This section is incomplete.

### Case Options

Asside from the cases that come with the Vault35 kits, there are a few community-made cases:
- [SK-Vault35](https://github.com/seirin-blu/SK-Vault35-Case)
- [Vault35 MFR2](https://github.com/seirin-blu/Vault35-MFR2)
- [FAT35]()
