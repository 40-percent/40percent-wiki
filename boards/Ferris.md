# Ferris

Ferris is a 34 key split keyboard, named after the Rustlang mascott, created by Pierre Chevalier. The Ferris is minimalistic: it aims to be a functional, ergonomic keyboard that is pleasing to use as a daily driver.

### Availability

The PCB is open sourced with all files available on [github](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris).

### Types

The Ferris comes in several different forms including:

*   ###### Ferris Base:

    This describes the first ever iteration of the Ferris keyboard: a plain pcb with support for choc switches, and the same layout as the Kyria (but limited to 34 keys).
*   ###### Ferris High:

    Similar the base variant, but with support for MX switches and updated copper pad and silkscreen.
*   ###### Ferris Low:

    Similar to the base variant, but with support for Choc mini switches and updated copper pad and silkscreen.
*   ###### Ferris Compact:

    Similar to the base variant, but with Choc spacing (17x18 mm) instead of MX spacing (18x19 mm). This means it isn't compatible with as many keycaps, but doesn't have gaps with keycaps that conform to the Kailh datasheet, like the MBK keycaps pictured.
*   ###### Ferris Bling:

    This version diverges slightly from the minimalism of other variants to offer a broader appeal. Some features are: choc switches with choc spacing, RGB backlighting, tenting puck support, case support, and all microcontroller pads are broken out for ease of repairability and modability.
*   ###### Ferris Mini:

    A barebones Ferris supporting choc mini switches in choc spacing. It also exposes all microcontroller pads for ease of repairability and modability.
*   ###### Ferris Sweep:

    A version of Ferris, modified by iamnotyourbroom, that uses a daughter board like a promicro, elite-c, bit-c, nice!nano etc. instead of using onboard components. Available on a separate [github](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) page.
