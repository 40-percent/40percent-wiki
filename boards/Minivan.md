# MiniVan

A MiniVan is a 4u x 12.75u rectangular board. The board (generally) keeps the traditional stagger from a larger board on its left hand side while having shorter modifiers. The right hand side also has shorter modifiers than a traditional keyboard would. It notably omits the `[{`, `}]`, and `'"` keys from the right side of the keyboard as well. As this wiki is meant to be more of an overview of each inidvidual board and 40% keyboards as a whole, not all information regarding the different types of MiniVans can reasonably be added to one article. For more information on MiniVan keyboards and their variants, visit the [Trashman Wiki](https://trashman.wiki).

### Availability

MiniVan PCBs can be source from many different locations but one of the easiest sources currently is [CBKBD](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/coffeevan-pcb-preorder)

### Layout

As MiniVan is one of the most common boards in the 40% community, MiniVans have a numerous amount of layouts some considered to be "true" MiniVan layouts (meaning that the top 3 rows are not modified from what was on the original MiniVan) and other more exotic layouts that change keycap sizes around to account for different layouts
